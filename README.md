Image Classification Fruits & Vegetables: 
In this project we aim to develop a CNN-based model for the automatic classification of fruits and vegetables from 
images. Leveraging the TensorFlow Keras framework, we seek to build a scalable and accurate system capable of 
distinguishing among different types of fruits and vegetables with high precision. The proposed model will be trained 
on a dataset consisting of diverse images of fruits and vegetables, encompassing variations in shape, size, color and 
texture. 
Technologies Used: Pandas, TensorFlow and Keras.
